<h5>1. SILENE TOMENTOSA</h5>
    <img class="responsive-img" src="../img/3_SILENE TOMENTOSA.jpg">
    <p>The Gibraltar Campion is very rare. Growing up to a foot high, the pink, white, or pale violet flowers are found only in Gibraltar. It was thought to be extinct until 1994, when some specimens were discovered at the Upper Rock Nature Reserve in Gibraltar. For now, that is the only place to see them in the wild, although you can also see the cultivated plants at the Gibraltar Botanic Gardens.

<h5>2. STRONGYLODON MACROBOTRYS</h5>
    <img class="responsive-img" src="../img/4_675px-Jade_vine_at_Allan_Gardens.jpg">
    <p>Strongylodon macrobotrys, or jade vine as it is more commonly known, is a species of woody vine festooned with blue-green flowers that can only be found in the tropical forests of the Philippines (primarily on Luzon, Mindoro, and Catanduanes Islands). The destruction of rainforests has threatened its habitat, although the botanists at Kew Gardens in England have had success growing the plant.

<h5>3. AMORPHOPHALLUS TITANUM</h5>
    <img class="responsive-img" src="../img/5_Titan-arum1web.jpg">
    <p>A plant you may be familiar with, the “Corpse Flower” blooms every 2-10 years and, when it does, emits an unpleasant odor not unlike that of a rotting animal. The flower is native only to the rainforests of western Sumatra.

<h5>4. RAFFLESIA LEONARDI</h5>

    <p>A parasitic plant endemic to the northern areas of the Philippines, Rafflesia leonardi was only discovered in 2005, in the northeastern region of the island of Luzon. Also called the “corpse flower” (yes, more than one flower goes by that name) because of the stink it gives off to attract pollinators, it has become a major tourist attraction and symbol of conservation for the area. It is part of the same genus as Rafflesia arnoldii, the largest flower in the world. Yet another species in the genus, Rafflesia philippensis, grows only on a single mountain in the Philippines—Mt. Banahaw.

<h5>5. ERICA ABIETINA</h5>

    <p>Erica abietina is endemic to Table Mountain, which overlooks Cape Town in South Africa. It produces masses of pink and red flowers and has seven main subspecies, some of which are critically endangered.
