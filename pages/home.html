            <h5>10 Facts About Turtle</h5>
          <p>1. Turtles belong to one of the oldest reptile groups in the world – beating snakes, crocodiles and alligators!</p>
          <p>2. These creatures date back to the time of the dinosaurs, over 200 million years ago – woah!</p>
          <p>3. Turtles are easily recognised by their bony, cartilaginous shell. This super-tough casing acts like a shield to protect them from predators – some turtles can even tuck their head up inside their shell for extra protection!</p>
          <p>4. Just like your bones, a turtle’s shell is actually part of its skeleton. It’s made up of over 50 bones which include the turtle’s rib cage and spine.</p>
          <p>5. Contrary to popular belief, a turtle cannot come out of its shell. The turtle’s shell grows with them, so it’s impossible for them to grow too big for it!</p>
